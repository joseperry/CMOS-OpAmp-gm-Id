📄 **Summary**:  
- This paper makes a systematic study of using the gm/ID method for initial sizing of the class of multi-stage Op Amps with Miller compensations.
- Proposes methods to derive constraints from design equations to make the gm/ID-based sizing more accurate and less simulation hungry.
- Further proposes heuristic sizing rules that are suited for application to multi-stage Op Amps for quickly working out acceptable sizing.
- Validaton of the effectiveness of the initial sizing method by Op Amp examples containing different number of stages.
- The proposed initial sizing method can be potentially integrated in an auto-sizing tool.
