# Two-Stage Operation Amplifier Design in CMOS Process Based on g<sub>m</sub>/I<sub>d</sub> methodology  

This project is being<!--TODO: in the end replace with "was"--> developed in the context of the **Course Final Project** as part of the **Electronics, Telecommunications and Computer Engineering BSc** at **ISEL - Lisbon School of Engineering** during the Summer Semester of 2024/25. The objective is to design and analyze a **two-stage CMOS operational amplifier (OpAmp)** using the **g<sub>m</sub>/I<sub>d</sub> methodology**, focusing on optimizing power efficiency while meeting performance specifications.  

## üìå Overview  

Operational amplifiers are a fundamental building block in analog circuit design, widely used in signal processing, sensor interfaces, and communication systems. The **g<sub>m</sub>/I<sub>d</sub> methodology** is a systematic approach that enables designers to size transistors efficiently, balancing gain, bandwidth, and power consumption.  

The process techonology used for this project is: **AMS 0.35&mu;m CMOS C35**
